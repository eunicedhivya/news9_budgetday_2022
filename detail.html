                    <p>When Mumbai sleeps, it dreams of land — to house its mushrooming population, to accommodate its cars,
                        to ease the daily
                        rush. Hemmed in by the sea and host to one of the densest human urban agglomerations in the world,
                        India’s financial
                        capital is looking seaward to find answers to its recurring and interrelated nightmare of space,
                        traffic, congestion and
                        commute. And it appears to have found it, in the form of a road over the sea.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>The Mumbai coastal road is a Rs. 8,000 crore mega infrastructure project that seeks to finally bring
                        the
                        city into the
                        new century, commensurate with its status as a historic business city of global repute. The road
                        will
                        run along the
                        western coast, on stilts over the Arabian Sea, and through tunnels under land. The space between the
                        new
                        road and the
                        existing shore will be reclaimed from the sea to make green open spaces and new promenades.
                        According to
                        government
                        planners, the coastal road’s 35 kilometres starting from Nariman Point in South Mumbai will take you
                        not
                        just to the
                        distant western suburb of Kandivali in the far north but even further — closer to Singapore and Hong
                        Kong.</p>
                    
                    <p>The road was first dreamt up by the Prithviraj Chavan government in 2011. But it only gathered steam
                        when the Bharatiya
                        Janata Party, which came to power both at the Centre and in Maharashtra, fast-tracked environment
                        clearances and made
                        necessary policy changes. For Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, the road, if implemented in his
                        tenure,
                        could well prove
                        to be his political legacy.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The village speaks</h2>
                    
                    <p>But the monumental task cannot be achieved so easily; the Mumbai of the future has still to deal with
                        the Mumbai of the
                        past. At the far end of Juhu Beach, at a place where an old creek emerges from the mangroves to meet
                        the
                        sea, lies a
                        fishing village called Moragaon. In a small room that serves as the community’s political office,
                        Rajesh
                        Mangela, a
                        slight, energetic man approaching middle age, stands in front of a large map of the village and
                        tells me
                        why he is angry
                        with the government. “This,” he says, pointing to an empty space on the map, “is where they
                        destroyed
                        our houses —
                        houses that we built with our own savings, our own hands. 160 of them. If you can’t do anything for
                        us,
                        at least don’t
                        destroy what we do for ourselves.”</p>
                    
                    <p>Rajesh was pursuing a postgraduate degree in law in the early 90s. He abandoned it midway when he
                        realised that his
                        village and the fishing community to which he belongs were under siege from the government and
                        developers. “I asked
                        myself, ‘What’s the point of a law degree if there is nothing left to build on?’ I didn’t want to
                        finish
                        my degree and
                        then realise that everything was gone.” Rajesh spent all his time organising people and putting
                        together
                        a resistance to
                        protect their land, or, as he puts it, “their natural right” as the original settlers of Mumbai.
                        Over
                        the years, he has
                        been involved in many a fight with the government over policy and urban planning technicalities;
                        nomenclature,
                        demarcation and ; and marginalisation.</p>
                    
                    <p>Over the years there have been a few wins and many losses. According to the villagers, Moragaon has
                        existed at its
                        present location for the past 80 years. As the population grew steadily, the village petitioned the
                        government for more
                        land to build houses, which the government provided under the protections afforded to villagers
                        under
                        government policy.
                        But the site they chose lay in no man’s land: across the creek, in the middle of mangroves, cut off
                        from
                        the rest of the
                        village. After numerous petitions failed to draw attention to the impracticality of the government
                        plan,
                        the village
                        took over an adjoining piece of land earmarked for a playground.</p>
                    
                    <p>They lived there for 10 years until the government summarily arrived in 2005 and destroyed their
                        homes.
                        The incident
                        still rankles with the villagers, especially when they see how building bylaws and regulations are
                        bent
                        and changed
                        regularly for the affluent in Mumbai. In the last 10 years, the villagers have seen an engineering
                        college, a hotel, a
                        big residential colony and many villas come up all around them, in the very same places that were
                        denied
                        to them because
                        they fell foul of regulations. One of those residential complexes, according to Rajesh, was built by
                        judges and Indian
                        Administrative Service officers. “Everybody wants to stay along the coastal area; why can’t we,” he
                        asks. “It is our
                        right. Like everyone, we also want clean air and a nice environment. Why should we move? Does the
                        coast
                        only belong to
                        judges and ministers? You should ask them how they made their money. We live a life of dignity
                        here.”</p>
                    
                    <p>Now, the latest threat to the village is the Mumbai coastal road, which could snatch away the
                        livelihoods of the
                        villagers. In its present</p>
